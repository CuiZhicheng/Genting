static files
1. create a directory in our app 'web_genting'
2. put static files directories consisting of 'css', 'js', 'images' into the directory created in step 2
3. modify the project's setting where the STATIC_URL should be '/static/'
4. validate the static files
    4.1 write view with RequestContext
    4.2 put some python-like script into *.html
        e.g. in index.htm, {% load staticfiles %}, and we can transfer arguments into the templates files
