User

1. 	When I modified the User model, I found that I could not change the tables of sqlite3 by syncdb.
	Last I got a method deleting the db directly to achieve my modification.

2. 	Complete Log in 
	1) create a view of log in.
		build POST and form to accmulate information for logging in.
	2) create a template of log in.
		entities of the form and the action is directed into 'index' again with a cookie.
